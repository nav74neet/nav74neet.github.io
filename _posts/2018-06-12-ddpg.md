## Intro  
<p style="text-align:justify">Walking is a very basic and indispensable action that is embedded in our daily life. We need to walk to traverse from one place to another. Although it seems to be obvious and too simple, its importance and the level of complexity is taken for granted quite often.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">But the same cannot be said in the case of a walking robot. There are lots of physical constraints associated with the model and the environment the robot interacts with. This requires complex levels of control theory and accurate mathematical computations. But there's an alternative solution to the problem of bipedal walking robot - Reinforcement Learning.</p>

## History
<p style="text-align:justify">While working at the Computational Intelligence Laboratory, at the Aerospace Engineering Division, IISc, I and my colleague Mr. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ioarun/" class="md-link">Arun Kumar</a> decided to explore the domain of machine learning for applications related to robotics. We were fascinated by the problem of bipedal walking robots and the challenges associated with it's dynamics and stability.</p>

        <p style="text-align:justify">
          Our initial approaches were inclined towards the classical approach of <strong>canonical walking functions</strong>, particularly inspired by the works of <a href="http://ames.gatech.edu/" class="md-link"> Dr. Aron D Ames</a> and his team at <a href="https://www.gatech.edu/" class="md-link">Georgia Tech</a> & <a href="http://www.bipedalrobotics.com/" class="md-link">AMBER Lab at Caltech</a>, related to <a href="http://ames.gatech.edu/ijbbr_2014.pdf" class="md-link">human inspired walking</a> frameworks for bipedal walking robots. Canonical walking functions are based on the human gait outputs such as knee & hip joint angles and horizontal distance of the hip during the gait, to formulate the controllers for the robot.

<p style="text-align:justify">We also decided to delve more into biologically inspired controllers and came across <strong>CPG</strong>, acronym for <strong>Central Pattern Generators</strong>. So what's a CPG?. Basically they are biological neuronal circuits that produce rhythmic outputs (even in the absense of rhythmic input or sensory feedback). They are the source of the tightly-coupled patterns of neural activity that drive rhythmic motions, for example walking</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">We were heavily influenced by the work of <a href="http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~gunes/" class="md-link">Atılım Güneş Baydin</a> on "<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0801.0830.pdf" class="md-link">Evolution of central pattern generators for the control of a five-link bipedal walking mechanism</a>". On a brief note, this paper describes the approach of determining the connectivity and oscillatory parameters of a CPG network through <strong>genetic algorithm(GA)</strong> optimization techniques. The CPG model adopted is that of a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00422-011-0432-z" class="md-link">Matsuoka's half-center oscillator model</a> shown here.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Simulation software framework for the planar bipedal walking robot is opensourced through GitHub <a href="https://github.com/nav74neet/ddpg_biped" class="md-link">here</a>. You can try out recent state of RL or ML algorithms such as <a href="https://blog.openai.com/openai-baselines-ppo/" class="md-link">PPO</a> or  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05477" class="md-link">TRPO</a> for generating walking patterns for the biped robot.</p>


<!-- <p style="text-align:justify">The reason we opted not to go forward with CPG based controllers was infact due to the random pattern generated by the network which did not account for the stability of the system. To consider the factor of dynamic stability of the system, we incorporated a balancing pendulum on top of the waist section of the walker with roll, pitch & yaw (to act as a spine). The balancing control would be taken care of by reinforcement learning where, the top pendulum tries to figure out the optimum pitch, yaw & roll values to stay upright. The CPG network will deal with the generation of walking pattern for the lower torso. But it was the case of easier said than done. </p>  -->
