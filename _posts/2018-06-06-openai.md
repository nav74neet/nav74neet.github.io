## What's this post about?
<p style="text-align:justify">
This post mainly focuses on the implementation of RL and imitation learning techniques for classical OpenAI gym' environments like cartpole-v0, breakout, mountain car, bipedwalker-v2, etc. I have implemented several RL algorithms such as dqn, policy gradient, etc. as well as generative adversaral learning approach like GAIL for imitation learning.

          <b>[1] Deep Q-Networks for Breakout-v0</b>: Maximize the score in the Atari 2600 game Breakout. In this environment, the observation is an RGB image of the screen, which is an array of shape (210, 160, 3) Each action is repeatedly performed for a duration of kkk frames, where kkk is uniformly sampled from {2,3,4}.
