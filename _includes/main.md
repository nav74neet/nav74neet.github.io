I graduated from <strong><a href="http://www.vit.ac.in/" class="md-link">VIT University, Vellore</a></strong> with bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering (2017). Right after graduation, I joined <strong><a href="https://new.abb.com/products/robotics" class="md-link">ABB's Robotics Motion Division</a></strong> in Bangalore as a Graduate Engineer Trainee (April,2017-August,2017). At ABB, I was part of the design and simulation team, developing the initial prototype version of Anthropomorphic Robot Arm(ARA) for collaborative robot applications.</p>

I recently joined <strong><a href="http://www.rbccps.org/" class="md-link">Robert Bosch Center for Cyber Physical Systems (RBCCPS)</a></strong> at IISc, Bangalore as a Project Assistant (since August,2018). My current research relates to fusion of machine learning (based on reinforcement learning & GANs) and control theory in the domain of robot manipulation & haptics interface. Research advisor(s): <a href="https://drona.csa.iisc.ac.in/~shalabh/" class="md-link"> Dr. Shalabh Bhatnagar</a> (Dept. of Computer Science and Automation, IISc), <a href="http://www.cense.iisc.ac.in/bharadwaj-amrutur" class="md-link">Dr. Bharadwaj Amrutur</a> (Dept. of Electrical Communication Engineering & RBCCPS, IISc) & <a href="https://shishirny.github.io/" class="md-link">Dr. Shishir N Y Kolathaya</a> (RBCCPS, IISc).

Prior to joining RBCCPS, I worked at the <strong><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/compintellab/home" class="md-link">Computational Intelligence Laboratory</a></strong> & <strong><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/compintellab/home/uavla" class="md-link">Advanced Flight Simulation Laboratory</a></strong> at the Aerospace Engineering Division of <strong><a href="https://iisc.ac.in/" class="md-link">Indian Institute of Science(IISc)</a></strong>, under the supervision of <a href="http://www.aero.iisc.ernet.in/people/s-n-omkar/" class="md-link">Dr. S N Omkar</a> (Chief Research Scientist) as a Project Assistant (August,2017-July,2018). My research primarily focused on developing simulation frameworks related to several robot learning algorithms for bipedal walking robot and autonomous navigation of UAVs in indoor environments. I had also worked on human motion dynamics & stability analysis using optical motion capture and musculoskeletal modelling softwares (like OpenSim & Adams LifeMod).</p>   
<br>
<p style="text-align:justify">My main research interests are in the domain of <strong>robotics(motion planing, manipulations, etc)</strong>, <strong>generative adversarial learning</strong> & <strong>reinforcement learning</strong>. I want to build agents that are generally intelligent and perform a wide variety of tasks rather being specific to one.</p>
