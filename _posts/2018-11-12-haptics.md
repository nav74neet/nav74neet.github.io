## Why this post?
<p style="text-align:justify">
While working on a machine learning project of mine, I recently came across a very simple but rather very complex problem. By "<strong>simple</strong>" I meant, for us <strong>humans</strong> it would be a very trivial task. But the same could not be said in the case of a robot, especially a <strong>simulated one</strong>.
